To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object. 
Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. 
Device index is just the number to specify which camera. 
Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). 
So I simply pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 
and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. 
But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture.

import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while(True):
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Our operations on the frame come here
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow('frame',gray)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# When everything done, release the capture
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
